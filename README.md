# Hackerrank-Demystified 

### Author: Alok Khansali

Just another repository, providing solutions to various Hackerrank Problems :)

Currently, this repository has solutions related to C++, Java, Python, Problem Solving, Mathematics,Sql and 30 Days Of Code.

Since I am also in a learning phase, so solutions to a lot of questions are still not available.
But I'm trying to answer all the questions available.

HAPPY CODING  :))
